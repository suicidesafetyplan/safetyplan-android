    <string name="suicidepreventiondesc">If you are suicidal, I want you to know that virtually every person that I have talked with who attempted suicide, and survived, was glad that they lived. So the emotions that were causing the suicidal feelings did pass. Things got better; the sun did come out. So, let me extend that hope to you.
\n\nPlease look at the Safety Plan module of this application. There, you can fill out a safety plan that can keep you safe during difficult times as well as find a list of helpful resources. Specifically, I want to encourage you to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). They are there to help you, even if you are not in a suicidal crisis.
