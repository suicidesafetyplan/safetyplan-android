# Suicide Safety Plan - Android
> Suicide Safety Plan is a free mobile application for suicide prevention.

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1003891579) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moodtools.crisis.app) | [Website](http://suicidesafetyplan.app/) | [Contact](mailto:moodtools@gmail.com)

This app is a mobile adaptation of a [Suicide Safety Plan](https://www.verywellmind.com/suicide-safety-plan-1067524), which is a suicide prevention tool that is widely used in healthcare facilities around the world. Safety plans allow people who struggle with suicidal ideation to follow their plan during a crisis and stay safe.

## üìú Principles
As a suicide prevention project, we are aware that we have to hold ourselves to a [higher standard](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1461-z#Tab1) than most other apps since our users are from a vulnerable population.

This project commits to:

* **Never charge money** so that users who need it most will be able to access all features of this app free of charge without upfront costs, in app purchases or advertisements.

* **Never sell data** so that users will be able to use the app in an anonymous manner without fear of being identified, tracked, or targeted.

* **Provide evidence-based content** so that users can benefit from techniques with a high probability of effectiveness and positive impact.
